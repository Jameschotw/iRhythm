Library source is organized as follows:

    readme              file containing general information
    inc or include      directory containing include files
    *_g			directories containing sources, by functional group

    archive             build directory
	makefile        makefile for standard "make" tool

Library builds may be customized by changing various settings at the
beginning of the makefile.

You may need to edit the makefiles to explicitly refer to the tools in
your distribution.

The "archive" directory may have a more complex directory structure than
shown above to facilitate building different configurations of the library.

If you wish to replace the distributed libraries with the libraries you build,
in some cases you may need to rename them.  For example, libraries
compiled to be non-thread-safe for use with the -Hnothread option should
not have the "t" suffix.
